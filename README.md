# Used-Car-Sales-Price-Prediction

Predicting Used Car Sale Price Using Feedforward Artificial Neural Networks

In this project, you will see how we can use a feedforward artificial neural network to predict the prices of cars. The car sale price prediction problem is a regression problem like house price prediction since the price of car is a continuous value.

In this project, we will see how to predict car sales prices using a densly connected neural network, which is a type of feedforward neural network. Here we will using the Tensorflow keras library to implement a feed forward neural network.
